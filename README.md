# Material Design Lite for Dart
> A library of [Material Design](http://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/introduction.html) components in CSS, Dart, and HTML
([MDL Dart website][mdldemo]).

Material Design Lite lets you add a Material Design look and feel to your static content websites. It doesnâ€™t rely on any JavaScript
frameworks or libraries. Optimised for cross-device use, gracefully degrades in older browsers, and offers an experience that is accessible
from the get-go.

## New
- mdl-model Component, Check out the [sample](http://samples.material-design-lite.pub/spa_model/index.html)

- More infos on ["home"](http://www.material-design-lite.pub/)

## Quick Start with StageDive
MDL/Dart has StageDive support!  
Try it out and follow these steps:

```bash
# if you don't have mdl installed
pub cache add mdl

# if you don't have stagedive installed or if you want to update stagedive
pub global activate stagedive

# if you don't have sitegen installed or if you want to update sitegen
# sitegen - will later act as a local server
pub global activate sitegen

stagedive -l

# You should see something like this

#   'MDL Android Template'         Package: mdl          Template name: android        Version: 1.x
#   'MDL Android Template'         Package: mdl          Template name: android        Version: 1.x
#   'MDL Article Template'         Package: mdl          Template name: article        Version: 1.x
#   'MDL Android Template'         Package: mdl          Template name: blog           Version: 1.x
#   'MDL Blog Template'            Package: mdl          Template name: dashboard      Version: 1.x
#   'MDL Fixed-Header Template'    Package: mdl          Template name: fixed-header   Version: 1.x
#   'MDL Sample Template'          Package: mdl          Template name: sample         Version: 1.x
#   'MDL Sticky-Footer Template'   Package: mdl          Template name: sticky-footer  Version: 1.x
#   'MDL Text-Only Template'       Package: mdl          Template name: text-only      Version: 1.x

# Now lets generate a new (-n) folder: android
stagedive -n android -p mdl -t android

# This is what stagedive asks you
#   Your email address: office@mikemitterer
#   Your name: Mike
#   Enter the package-name: android_mdl
#
#   'MDL Android Template' created! (android)

# move the the newly created dir
cd android

# Update everything
pub update

# Serve the site (you are in 'android'!)
sitegen -x

# In Chromium/Dartium
localhost:8000
```

### Hint
Short form for the last 4 commands: `cd android/ && pub update && sitegen -x || cd -`

This is how it stagedive gets its [template](https://goo.gl/O2gis7) 

## Quick Start

In `pubspec.yaml` specify the `mdl`, `browser` and `di` packages as dependencies, as well as the `di` transformer.

```yaml
dependencies:
  mdl: "^1.0.0"
  browser: '^0.10.0'
  di: "^3.3.4"
transformers:
  - di
```

Add the mdl style sheet to your `index.html`

```html
<link id="theme" rel="stylesheet" href="packages/mdl/assets/styles/material.min.css">
```

Initialize the mdl library from your `main.dart`

```dart
import 'package:mdl/mdl.dart' as mdl;


main() async {
  mdl.registerMdl();
  await mdl.componentFactory().run();
}

```


## Icons

Material Design Lite uses the official [Material Icons font](https://www.google.com/design/icons/). We recommend you include it using:

```html
<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/icon?family=Material+Icons"
      rel="stylesheet">
```

You can check for other options on the [Developer's Guide](http://google.github.io/material-design-icons/#icon-font-for-the-web).
