# Material Design Light for Dart

A port of Googles Material Design Light to Dart<br>
You can find the original version here on [GitHub][mdlmaterial].

Material Design Light strives to give you a high performance starting point out of the box
Responsive layout is included with the kit that adapts to fit the device your user is viewing it on. 

[Demo][mdldemo] (transpiled JS-Version)

If you work with AngularDart the [mdl-angular-Version][mdlangular] could be interesting for you.

## Usage

Please check out my [samples][samples]. They are short and easy to read.
Since v0.6.1 every [sample][samples] shows a little "Load indicator"!

Just a very basic theming-sample can be found [here][themingsample]
```shell
    assets$ sassc scss/styleguide.scss css/styleguide.css
    assets$ autoprefixer css/styleguide.css
```
